        <h1 class="hello">Hello, I'm Kim!</h1>
        <p>
            I'm currently living the dream in Salt Lake City, UT with my cute little family. I have 2 young boys,
            another baby on the way, and a super supportive partner. I'm a financial risk officer with a niche specialty
            in portfolio compliance and working with emerging teams to best position for exponential growth. I've had
            great opportunities to work with software vendors and cross-collaborate with other departments in my
            firm.<br>
            <br>What I've found is that I most enjoy the start up feel, setting up the ground work and working through
            new
            project challenges. Finding solutions makes me happy! As a leader, I also really care about career
            development. That includes myself! I'm always looking for new ways to grow and challenge myself and help
            inspire others to find their path too. My next career goals would be to strengthen my tech skills and take
            that leap with the next opportunity!
